# informal - Quick PHP forms

The title says it all. If you have a need to create PHP forms quickly with file or image uploads, this is a tool for you.

Basically the idea is that you describe the form fields in `fields.php` and the form will be autogenerated for you - as well as the database inserts and e-mailing functionality.

So a visitor fills in the form and submits it, the submission is stored in the database and you receive an email with the details.

## Why I made it?

I hate making forms an I believe it's the most boring thing.

So I made a reusable system so I don't have to do the same thing every goddamn time.

## TO DO:

* Select2 integration - select templates
* iCheckbox integration - checkbox and radio button templates
* Any file upload - similar to image template
* Dropzone.js integration - dropzone image upload template
* `config.php` - configuration file, to set the database connection and other details
* Recaptcha integration
* Form description JSON `form.json`
* Multiple forms on the page - form class as a form abstraction
* Backend validation
* Fronted validation
* Email confirmation
* Entry admin
